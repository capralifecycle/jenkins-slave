# Jenkins slave

This repository contains the Docker image for Jenkins slave used with
our Jenkins 2 setup.

This image itself is not run directly by ECS, but is run inside a wrapper
image. See https://github.com/capralifecycle/jenkins-slave-wrapper

Details about our setup is available on https://confluence.capraconsulting.no/x/uALGBQ
